XSDParser:
- Add xmlns xmpp-stanzas to error elements xsd. Dont try to do the namespace
  chaining right. Madness therin lies.
- Make comments follow the full subtree before leaving comment state. Dont
  act on contents of comment tag.
- Grok simpleContent subject and body on message uses it
- Follow custom types for elements/attrs. XEP 0009 depends on this.
- make Elem.multi an optional syntax object that XSDParser creates
+ chain ns's down the tree. store named nses.
