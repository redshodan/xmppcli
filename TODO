XSDParser:
- Add xmlns xmpp-stanzas to error elements xsd. Dont try to do the namespace
  chaining right. Madness therin lies.
- Make comments follow the full subtree before leaving comment state. Dont
  act on contents of comment tag.
- Grok simpleContent subject and body on message uses it
- make Elem.multi an optional syntax object that XSDParser creates
- Properly grok min/max occurs, usage restrictions, <xs:all>, <xs:choice>, etc.
- Load up the set of disco features for tab completing.
+ chain ns's down the tree. store named nses.
+ Follow custom types for elements/attrs. XEP 0009 depends on this.
